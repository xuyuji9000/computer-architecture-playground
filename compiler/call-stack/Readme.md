- **To understand call stack intuitively, need to be able to manipulate stack with x86 assembly.**

- **To write better stack manipulation assembly code, need to be comformatable with writing assembly in the first place.**

- **In conclusion, more assembly code practice is needed**

- Refer to this repo for more assembly practice. [xuyuji9000/assembly-playground](https://github.com/xuyuji9000/assembly-playground)
